## Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD) – Classes and Objects

**What is OOAD?**

OOAD is a method to design software by thinking in terms of real-world objects instead of just code.
We first analyze what the software needs (requirements) and then design it using the concept of objects.

**Why do we need it?**

- Makes software easier to understand (real-world thinking).
- Helps reuse code.
- Encourages modular design (breaking into small, manageable parts).
- Easier to maintain and update.

**How it works?**

- Analysis – Identify the problem, the real-world objects involved, and their relationships.
- Design – Represent those objects as classes in code and define how they interact.

**Key Terms**

- Class – Blueprint/template (e.g., Car class describes features of any car).
- Object – Real thing created from the blueprint (e.g., a red Honda City car).

## UML Diagrams with PlantUML – Introduction

**What is UML?**

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a visual way to show the structure and behavior of software.
Think of it like maps for software.

**Why do we need UML?**

- Helps communicate ideas between developers, designers, and clients.
- Makes design easy to review before coding.
- Acts as documentation for future developers.

**What is PlantUML?**

A tool where we write text to generate UML diagrams (no manual drawing).
It works in VS Code, IntelliJ, and online editors.
